                            <p>We invest our time and capital in companies at an&nbsp;early stage, typically when founders have
                                identified a problem and have created at least a prototype of their product or service. We
                                only work on a handful of projects at a time. We prefer to focus our time and capital where
                                we can make the biggest difference.</p>

                            <p>Every company we work with is different, and so is the way we work with them. You might find
                                one of us working in an interim operational post, such as CFO, head of product, or legal
                                counsel, or we might be called in to recruit key people for the team. You could also expect
                                us to be involved at a strategic level, with brand development, and to participate in the
                                company’s board of directors.</p>

                                committed supporters of our companies in the long term.</blockquote>

And also to create the systems that design perfectly optimised food and feeding plans for each individual dog.</p>









<p>We validate all of our research with an independent nutritionist who has nearly 30 years of experience in animal nutrition. From a Degree in Animal Sciences and a PhD in Nutritional Biochemistry to varied research and development roles within the pet food industry, formulating and developing diets, studying feeding habits and ensuring strict quality control as well as lecturing nutrition students, our go-to pet food nutrition expert is uniquely qualified to ensure we are delivering the best for every dog.</p>"
